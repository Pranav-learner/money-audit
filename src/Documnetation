Finance Tracker + Splitwise Clone
🚀 Phase 1 Report — Foundation & Infrastructure Setup
🎯 Objective of Phase 1

To establish a production-ready backend foundation before implementing business logic.

Phase 1 focused on:

Project setup

Environment configuration

Containerization

Dependency management

Clean architecture preparation

🏗️ 1️⃣ Technology Stack Finalized
Component	Technology Chosen	Reason
Backend	Spring Boot 3.5.10	Stable, production-ready
Java	Java 21 (LTS)	Modern LTS version
Database	PostgreSQL 15	Strong relational DB
Containerization	Docker	Environment consistency
Build Tool	Maven	Standard Spring build system
🧱 2️⃣ Backend Project Initialization

Project generated using Spring Initializr with:

Selected Dependencies

Spring Web

Spring Data JPA

PostgreSQL Driver

Spring Security

Validation

Lombok

Spring Boot DevTools

Spring Mail

Additionally:

JWT dependency added manually (jjwt 0.11.5)

📂 3️⃣ Project Architecture Structure

We implemented a feature-based modular structure, instead of a flat layer structure.

Base Package:
com.pranav.financetracker

Feature-Based Structure:
auth/
user/
category/
expense/
group/
split/
settlement/
friend/
savings/
budget/
analytics/
email/
scheduler/
config/
common/


Each feature will contain:

controller/

service/

repository/

entity/

dto/

Why Feature-Based?

Scalable for large systems

Easier maintenance

Clear domain separation

Industry-level architecture

🐳 4️⃣ Database Containerization

PostgreSQL was containerized using Docker.

docker-compose.yml created at project root.

Configuration includes:

PostgreSQL 15 image

Database: finance_tracker

Username: postgres

Password: postgres

Persistent volume for data

Database started using:

docker compose up -d


This ensures:

No local DB installation required

Reproducible environment

Easy future deployment

⚙️ 5️⃣ Application Configuration

Created and configured application.yml with:

PostgreSQL datasource connection

Hibernate configuration

SQL logging

JWT configuration

Mail configuration (SMTP)

Server port configuration

🔐 6️⃣ Java 21 Setup & Environment Configuration

System was configured to use:

JDK 21 (LTS)

Steps included:

Installing JDK 21

Setting JAVA_HOME system variable

Updating PATH

Verifying using:

java -version
mvn -v


Ensured Maven compiles using Java 21.

🛠️ 7️⃣ Scheduling Enabled

Spring scheduling enabled using:

@EnableScheduling


No additional dependency required.

This prepares system for:

Weekly summary emails

Future background jobs

📦 8️⃣ JWT Setup Prepared

JWT dependencies added:

jjwt-api

jjwt-impl

jjwt-jackson

System now ready for:

Token-based authentication

Secure APIs

✅ 9️⃣ Build Verification

Project successfully compiled using:

mvn clean install


Application started successfully.

Database connection verified.

Docker container running correctly.

🔥 Key Achievements of Phase 1

Production-grade project structure

Containerized database

Java 21 environment configured

Secure-ready backend setup

Scheduling ready

Mail integration ready

JWT dependency integrated

Clean modular architecture established

🧠 Architectural Decisions Taken

Used Java 21 (LTS) instead of experimental versions.

Avoided Spring Boot SNAPSHOT versions.

Used Docker from Day 1.

Chose feature-based modular architecture.

Prepared JWT and Mail early for future integration.
